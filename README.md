# HondaTiresEcommerceApp

An E-Commerce Full-Stack Web App for customers that own a Honda Civic or Accord. Customers are required to register for an account and they will be able to purchase tires that come with different brands such as Toyo
Tires and Yokohama, and different sizes based on their car model. The Web app is responsive and contains user registration, user login authentication, product cards, shopping carts, search engine, and checkout.

Implemented the Back-End with Node.js, MongoDB, ExpressJS. Implemented Front-End with HTML, CSS, Javascript, And Bootstrap. Applied Security and Authentication with Passport.js and Cookies.

As this E-Commerce App was developed and deployed for personal project, and contains tire products for Honda cars, I have decided not to add the payment system to the web app features. In the future, I will create another repository to show how to build a payment system by integrating PayPal API.
